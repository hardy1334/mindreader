1. Breason out 250 br A - as receiver/idea	
2. Time this for A for the topic breasoned out and not breasoned out at random intervals for an interval of time (not to do with the random intervals), person to me
3. Does it take considerably longer for detected As? - calculate median of mostly hopefully false trials and differences from it x labelled graph first - do 10 trials over 10 minutes with 3 hopefully successful attempts that are labelled

Is it detecting what I am really thinking (or someone else) are the thoughts intertwined - all x

I seem to have really thought about 1. the main character 2. the reason 3. the next character 4. what was later 5. who would put them away

Is the seen as version able to be used?  Is it a stream of consciousness detector?

***250s for dotting yourself on speaking and dotting yourself receiving, and yourself speaking and yourself receiving (each day?)

*** think to binary opposition x objects to either side - just do 250s for l,r, then turn off with a 250

*** put back positive protective thoughts on top, just do 250, then turn off with 250
