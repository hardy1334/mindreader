# mindreader
Contains Prolog programs that can be used by an individual to read their mind using meditation

So far, contains characterbr.pl, that helps generate 250 word breasoning traces of the algorithm drawing characters, used to recognise those characters.

Load each as ['filename']. given filename.pl

run each using sectest(Score).

Note: Needs screen installed to help you mind read the computer's thoughts (requires finished music composer and combination algorithm writer with predicates), still in pipes, but can still read your mind.

%% before running texttobr-based mind reader, to avoid conjunctivitis and haemorrhoids, think of two radio buttons put on recordings, put through with prayer, nut and bolt, quantum box prayer 1, 1, 0.5 cm and 1, 1, 0.5 cm.

The rest of the mind reading programs are in the List Prolog repository.

Caution: follow instructions in https://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter/blob/master/Instructions_for_Using_texttobr(2).pl.txt when using texttobr, texttobr2 or mind reader to avoid medical problems.

Please read init.txt to initialise any new mind reading algorithms.
